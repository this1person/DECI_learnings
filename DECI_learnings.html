<h1> Topics I Enjoyed the most </h1>
<p>There are many topics I enjoyed throughout my journey in DECI, But I can say that my favourite topic of all time is multi-media! I enjoy looking at photos and videos! And I also like listening to music and audio sounds, that's why I really enjoy talking or learning about multi-media.</p>

<h1> Topics I thought were difficult </h1>
<p>I thought that HTML is very hard and confusing, I don't really know why, But later I found that HTML was kind of easy, and there isn't any problems about it. the same as CSS, I thought it's also confusing like HTML and the same as HTML, I thought that CSS is very hard, but now it is not! it's actually fun!</p>
